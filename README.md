# SC3: <U>S</U>implet <U>C</U>ounting using <U>C</U>olor <U>C</U>oding

Source code for the paper under review.

* **SC**3 is the algorithm for counting simplets of size 4 and 5 based on Color Coding method where simplets are isomorphic classes of connected induced subcomplexes.
* **SC3**, which extends CC from graphlets to simplets, have following properties:
  1. accurate compare to baseline
  2. fast and scalable
* Especially, the counts of simplets by SC3
